# wordlist-rewriter
This command line utility is made to rewrite wordlists based on certain conditions. For example you can only allow numbers from a certain wordlist. Or maybe not allow them.
It is mainly intended for those who want to make wordlists with certain criterias from a wordlist that has lines which do not meet those criterias. it's intended for bruteforcing targeted wordlists. I don't know if you can use it for other things.

## Dependencies
* Only python 3. for the python version.
* Make and gcc if you want to compile the C version (you probably won't have to, there's a compiled binary already).
* Nothing if you want to try the binary (included with the source code).

## Differences
* The python version is the most bug free and the most tested. It's also the first to get new features and bug fixes. But at the cost of speed.
* The C file is version is way faster. So in read world scenarios, it is the more useful one.
* The binary included is just the result of compiling the C file.

(note that this project is for fun and for sharpening my skills buy training. that's all)
